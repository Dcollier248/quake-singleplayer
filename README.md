After you got the health, ammo, and a armor, you will fight the 3 bosses ahead of you. It's better for you to keep your distance because getting to close too the enemies, can affect your health if they damage you up close

The textures I added was +2dem5, afloor1_8, 64_grey_4, different types of other textures that you will see in the level
